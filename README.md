# Glassmorph-brochure
My first project, a brochure site for a business with some glassmorphism and vanilla js.
This is a small and quick brochure site for a catfe, the actual place exists although i didnt make this project for them they have their own site.
It is ment to introduce a user to a cafee with cats and get them to visit, also its a little project to showcase some of my skills since i am generally new in web development.
Hope you like it, if you have any suggestions to improve the code or to make any changes please feel free to tell me as i am still learning and honing my skills in this field!!
